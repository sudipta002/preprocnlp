Text Preprocessing with Python

This repository contains Python code for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/ lemmatization.

**Dependencies:**

- Python 3.9
- NLTK library

**How to use:**

- Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
- Install the NLTK library if you haven't already by running pip install nltk.
- Open the text_preprocessing.py file in your preferred Python environment.
- Import the text_preprocessing module by adding from text_preprocessing import preprocess_text at the top of your script
- Use the preprocess_text(text) function to preprocess your input text. The function takes one argument, the text you want to preprocess, and returns a list of processed tokens.

**Example:**

from text_preprocessing import preprocess_text

text = "This is a sample sentence for text preprocessing."

processed_tokens = preprocess_text(text)
print(processed_tokens)
